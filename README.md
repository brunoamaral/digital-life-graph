digital-life-graph
==================

Tiny bit of helper code to build a simple service / device usage graph

A very simple example with my own data (cof cof, if I trust my 30m review of it) is included in the example folder, should be easy to adapt to your own version

Requirements
============

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/)
